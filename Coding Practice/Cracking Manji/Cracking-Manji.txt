Write a NIOS II assembly-language loop (a complete program is not
required) to transfer data words to the external device connected to the
given port. The words to be transferred begin at location LIST, and the
number of words to be transferred is available at location N (this is the
terminating condition, which changes). The port status flag is in bit 3.

.equ STATUS_FLAG            0x0004

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

movia   r2, LIST            # where list is defined elsewhere
movia   r3, N               # N = len(LIST)
movia   r4, STATUS_REG      # moving the status register

loop:
    ldw     r5, 0(r4)                   # getting the data from the status register
    andi    r5, r5, STATUS_FLAG         # masking off the status flag bit
    movi    r6, STATUS_FLAG             # moving the value of the flag into r6

    bne     r5, r6, loop                # checking if status flag has been raised

# past this point, it has fallen through, start moving words from the list
    movia   r8, DATA_REG

    ldw     r7, 0(r2)                   # fetching first element from list
    stw     r7, 0(r8)                   # store content r7 into 0(r8)

    addi    r2, r2, 4                   # increment list pointer (4 is size of word)
    subi    r3, r3, 1                   # decrement length of list
    
    bne     r3, r0, loop                # if r3 (list len) is not 0, keep looping
